\section{Summary}
Rasmus is a student of knowledge with genuine curiosity regarding the essential workings of the world. With an open mind he adopts the philosophy that one can always improve oneself and that each day contains opportunities that has to be seized. Due to the characteristic of software development it demands a mix of social, logical, and artistic aspects in order to excel
in. This is why Rasmus has chosen software development as his primary field of interest. As a natural approach he chose an academic road which had a low-level foundation in terms of programming but still explored areas such as visualisation and UX. Which is why C/C++ augmented with higher lever languages is the tools of his choice.

Rasmus excels at planning and organizing his surroundings and because of that he often finds himself in a position to
coordinate others, something he does well. However, as a personality trait Rasmus believes that a person never can be
completely perfect, as a results he always aims to improve himself by an iterative process where he reflects on his own
actions and the actions of others. By combining his skill in organization with self evaluation he tries to identify and
prevent pitfalls and problems before they occur.
